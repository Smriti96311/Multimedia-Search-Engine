# Multimedia-Search-Engine
My first Project

This project is mainly being focused on developing a multi-media search engine which would be capable of searching audio, video and images with query itself being any audio,video, or image.

But in the first part, I am working on the developing a CBIR(Content Based Image Retrieval) based system for reverse image searching starting with grayscale+black-white appearing images. Currently lots of methods for doing the same are yet to be tried to find the best method among all.

The method used in this project is the basic one just to understand how image can be processed and how on a query image, the subsequent results can be displayed (the black and white portion of the images have been calculated in terms of percentage), and the images with nearest 10 percentages are displayed in result.
